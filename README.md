## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download**: Get the project files
2. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. **Start Using**: No installation required - it's a client-side application

## How It Works

### For Task Posters:
1. **Post a Task**: Describe what you need, when, where, and how much you'll pay
2. **Review Applications**: See who wants to help and their qualifications
3. **Assign Helper**: Choose the best applicant for your task
4. **Mark Complete**: Confirm when the work is done

### For Helpers:
1. **Browse Tasks**: Find tasks that match your skills and availability
2. **Apply**: Submit a short application with your experience
3. **Get Assigned**: Wait for the poster to choose you
4. **Complete Work**: Do the task and get paid

## Sample Tasks

The application comes with sample data including:
- Pet care (feeding cats, dog walking)
- Assembly help (furniture, picture frames)
- Moving assistance (boxes, deliveries)
- Errands (grocery runs, printing)
- Study help (tutoring, study partners)
- Tech support (laptop cleanup)

## Safety Features

- **Public Meetings Only**: All tasks must be completed in public spaces
- **Clear Guidelines**: Comprehensive safety rules and best practices
- **Payment After Completion**: No upfront payments required
- **Identity Verification**: Encourages meeting verification
- **Emergency Contacts**: Quick access to help resources

## Data Management

- Data persists between browser sessions
- No server required
- Works offline
- Data is stored locally on the user's device

## Browser Compatibility

## Educational Context

2. A helper nearby applies with availability
3. Ally assigns the helper
4. Helper completes daily check-ins and gets paid $45 after day 3

### Scenario 2: Jessica's Futon Assembly
1. Jessica posts: "Assemble futon, this afternoon, $30, Lakeside Apts lobby"
2. A neighbor applies with assembly experience
